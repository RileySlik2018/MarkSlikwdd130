                “At first I was really nervous about getting into the raft,  I had never done anything like this before and I thought that going white water rafting was maybe too much for me. But once we got on the raft and set out  it turned out to be one the most exciting and fun things I have ever done, I would love to go again and bring even more friends with me because it was just so much fun rafting down the river”.- Totally real person Susan

“ I came on this trip hoping to make wonderful memories with my family. Our daughter was too young to go on any of the more extreme rafting trips but luckily our tour guide took us on the perfect little adventure.  He took us to this chasm that was covered wall to wall in  little waterfalls and plants.  At the end of the chasm was a pool of water with a small beach that I stopped at for lunch, it was honestly one the best trips I have ever taken with my family. Between the amazing sites and great staff I would definitely come again”- not an AI person , Dave
