      </p>
      <h2>Main topic: Home page</h2>
      <p>Why will people come to my site? The main reason people will come to my site is because it will be a professional looking website for landscaping services that will give off a sense of confidence that they can trust. The website is meant to talk about and show how great the services are. The most common question customers will have when coming to this site is what services are being offered and how much are they. I couldn’t really answer how much it will be because not every job is the same but as for what services are being offered, that can be made easy to answer by showing what services there are in the two subpages of this website. On the website there will be a way to get in contact and request a  quote for how much the service is. There are a lot of landscaping services out there but this website will show off how great the services are and talk about how important that landscaping be done right and the wonderful impacts it can have. When landscaping is done wrong it can be costly and very time consuming to fix  anything that has happened. A great example of this is emergency sprinkler repair can cost about $100 an hour, so it is much better that everything be done correctly in the first place.</p>

      <h3>Winter and Fall</h3>
      <p>
        This page talks about the winter and fall services offered like snow removal or leaf removal
      </p>
      <h2>Main topic: Winter and Fall</h2>
      <p>This page talks about the specific services offered by the company in Winter and Fall. These services range from snow removal, ice removal, leaf removal , and winterization of any sprinkler pipes. These services are often highly sought after because all these are time consuming tasks that must be taken care of else it could cause issues. The winterization of pipes is especially a sought after service because not everyone knows how to prep sprinkler pipes for winter or what it entails. Snow removal is a task that is very much needed because without snow removal it can cause damage to sidewalks and roads and even cause ice to build up which can cause people to fall. Snow removal is important but it's not always easy. That's why, especially for people or businesses with a lot of land, it is often a task outsourced to someone else. This page is meant to showcase that this company can handle that snow removal need.

      <h3>Spring and Summer</h3>
      <p>
        This page talks about the spring and summer services offered like mowing grass or sprinkler repair
      </p>
      <h2>Main topic: Spring and Summer</h2>
      <p>This page talks about the services being offered by the company during the Summer and Spring. These services range from lawn mowing, planting new plants or gardens, installing new sprinklers, repairing sprinklers, and pesticide/herbicide spraying.  One of the main points about this page is about sprinklers because this can  be a highly sought after service that a lot of people and businesses seek out. Having a well maintained lawn is heavily affected by how much it is watered but improperly installed sprinklers could cause more harm than good, this can often lead to people searching for professional services for their sprinklers and it's not just enough to have someone come out they need to be competent because emergency sprinkler repair service can be very expansive , so it important that the job be done right in the first place. This page is meant to show off how competent and great the services are for this company. Another service that many people don’t want to handle themselves is herbicide and pesticide spraying, spraying for these can really help a garden or lawn thrive but it can also be dangerous and harmful because it is basically poison being sprayed. So unless you know what you are doing it's best to leave it to the professional for this task.
